            >Digital Product</span
          >
          is a goods or services that is used in digital form. Unlike physical
          product that can be touched and hold, digital product can only be used
          and accessed with electronic devices, such as smartphone, laptop, and
          other other devices that connect with internet.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          There are 3 aspect in digital product or we call it
          <b>Core Product Team</b> is..
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Business is a Product Manager</li>
          <li>User is a UI/UX Designer</li>
          <li>Tech is a Software Engineer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If that 3 aspect is balanced, we call it a <b>Sweet Spot Area</b>.
          Sweet spot area is a result from accurate research, analysis, and
          strategy. When you can combine customer needs with your business
          capabilities and appropriate technology, you will have the best chance
          of creating successful and sustainable digital products.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Beside core product team, there is also another team that called
          <b>Support Team</b> and that is..
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data Analyst</li>
          <li>Researcher</li>
          <li>Product Marketing</li>
          <li>Tester Automation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          But, that position could be different from each company (according to
          what is needed).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When you build a digital product, you must know about the stage of
          making it and type of life cycle that you want to use with your team.
          Let me give you a little bit insight of it ^-^
        </p>
        <p><b>1. Product Development Stage</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Discovery Stage
            <p>
              In this stage, the process is about research and analysis so that
              you can build features on digital product based on what is user
              needs. User experience designer will do this step.
            </p>
            <ul type="square">
              <li>Competitor analysis</li>
              <li>Customer Listening</li>
              <li>Business Performance</li>
              <li>Survey Online</li>
              <li>Demand Planning</li>
              <li>Business Problem</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Design Stage
            <p>
              At this step, the process is about designing the product which
              will be built. Capability of designing user interface is required
              in here so that user can use the product well, comfortable, and
              not confused about the flow.
            </p>
            <ul type="square">
              <li>Workshop Ideation</li>
              <li>Lo-Fidelity Design</li>
              <li>Hi-Fidelity Design</li>
              <li>Prototyping</li>
              <li>Usability Testing</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Delivery Stage
            <p>
              In this stage, the process is about coding the design into real
              product that user can use. Only a software engineer that able do
              this because this stage needs someone who understand how to make
              code eficiently and easy to maintenance.

              <li>Product Deployment</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <p><b>2. Software Development Life Cycle</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Waterfall
            <p>
              Developing a product in one big scope and generally. This kind of
              life cycle can takes months to be done because if there's mistake
              or problem in next step, it's hard to go back to previous step
              (<strong><em>every step must be prices</em></strong
              >).
